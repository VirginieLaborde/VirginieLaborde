## Hi there 👋

### 💬 About me
I'm Virginie, almost 40, from Nantes (north-western France). 
I spent 15 years in Supply chain management, then decided I needed to learn more about coding and manipulating data.

I just finished a 6-month course at the O'clock coding school (https://oclock.io/). I studied JavaScript (fullstack).

I'm curious, patient, **love** debugging (really! and I genuinely love to help debugging, too!), and aim to code as clean as possible.

### Languages, frameworks and tools
* HTML5, CSS3, Sass
* **JavaScript ES6+**
* **NodeJS**
* **VueJS** and its ecosystem: Vue Router, Vuex, and Vuetify (material design framework)
* NPM 
* **SQL / PostgreSQL**
* Neo4j / Cypher
* Sqitch
* Redis
* Test driven development (using Chai & Mocha)
* **Git, Github, Gitlab, Redmine**
* Agile development
* Trello, Slack, Teams

### What I'm working on
I just started my first official job as a Front-end Developer 🥳 I'm learning Vue.js and its ecosystem, and I'm loving it 😍
I chose to start as a front-end developer because I had mainly worked back-end so far, so I needed more front-end experience !

### My repositories 
#### API_jeux-de-societe_VirginieLaborde
An API I designed during my training, to help me maintain my boardgames collection. The first version is stable, and I'm working on updates.

### ⚡ Fun fact
I originally have a engineer's degree in mechanics, but don't ask me  why your car won't start, because I specialized in Supply Chain Management !
