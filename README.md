## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ’¬ About me
I'm Virginie, almost 40, from Nantes (north-western France). 
I spent 15 years in Supply chain management, then decided I needed to learn more about coding and manipulating data.

I just finished a 6-month course at the O'clock coding school (https://oclock.io/). I studied JavaScript (fullstack).

I'm curious, patient, **love** debugging (really! and I genuinely love to help debugging, too!), and aim to code as clean as possible.

### Languages, frameworks and tools
* HTML5 / CSS3
* **JavaScript ES6+**
* **NodeJS**
* NPM 
* **SQL / PostgreSQL**
* Neo4j / Cypher
* Sqitch
* Redis
* Git / Github
* Test driven development (using Chai & Mocha)
* Agile development
* Trello, Slack

### What I'm working on
I just finished the first version of my end-of-course peer project, which we streamed on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/Jyh9R5xPMuM?t=420) March 23rd. Our project starts at 7:00, and it's in French. 
I'm now still working on it, and it will hopefully help me obtain a [Professional Diploma](https://www.francecompetences.fr/recherche/rncp/31114/).

### My repositories 
#### API_jeux-de-societe_VirginieLaborde
An API I designed during my training, to help me maintain my boardgames collection. The first version is stable, and I'm working on updates.
